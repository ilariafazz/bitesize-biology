                    <p>Last summer I spent 24 days isolated in the wild, canoeing down the picturesque Missinaibi River in northern Ontario. I faced whatever nature threw at me daily, learning anything and everything I could about my surroundings.
                    This trip only further solidified my passion for biology and understanding the world around me. Ever since I was young I remember always being curious, always having questions and always genuinely wondering how things around me worked. 
                    <br />
                    <br />Whether it was by spending countless days exploring the woods outside my Nonnaâ€™s farm, summers at sleepaway camp, immersed in the great outdoors, or even in the lecture room of my grade eleven biology class, I love understanding how systems work together all throughout life. 
                    Naturally, meeting Dharini and starting BiteSize Biology allows me to share my passion for curiosity in the realm of biology to elementary students.</p>
